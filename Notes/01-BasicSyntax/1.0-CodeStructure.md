## Basic Structure of a C# Program

A C# program typically starts with the **namespace** declaration and ends with a **closing curly brace**. Here’s a simple example of the basic structure:

```csharp
using System;  // Importing namespaces (libraries)

namespace MyProgram  // Defining a namespace
{
    class Program  // Declaring a class
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)  // Main method - entry point of the program
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");  // Statement inside the Main method
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Components of the Code Structure:

1. **`using` Directives**
    
    At the top of most C# files, you will find `using` directives, which are used to import namespaces. These namespaces provide access to various classes and functions from the .NET Framework or other libraries. The `using` directive allows you to use these classes without needing to specify the full path.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    using System;  // Importing the System namespace, which includes common classes like Console, String, etc.
    ```
    
    This allows you to directly use `Console.WriteLine()` without needing to fully specify `System.Console.WriteLine()`.
    
2. **Namespace**
    
    A **namespace** in C# is a container that holds classes, structs, enums, and other namespaces. It helps organize your code and prevent naming conflicts by grouping related code together. While you don't have to use namespaces, they are a good practice to structure your code logically.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    namespace MyProgram  // Defining a namespace
    {
        class Program  // Code related to the Program class goes here
        {
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Namespaces are often named according to the project or purpose of the code, and the convention is to use **PascalCase** (capitalizing each word).
    
3. **Class Declaration**
    
    A C# program is made up of **classes**. Each class defines a type that contains members such as fields, properties, methods, and events. C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, and every C# program has at least one class.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    class Program  // A class named Program
    {
        // Class members go here
    }
    ```
    
    The **class** keyword is followed by the name of the class (in PascalCase). Inside the class, you define the behavior (methods, properties, etc.) and data (fields, variables).
    
4. **Main Method**
    
    Every C# program starts execution from the **`Main` method**. This is the entry point of the program. The `Main` method is typically **static** (since it is called without an instance of the class), and it can accept an array of arguments (`string[] args`) that are passed from the command line when the program starts.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    static void Main(string[] args)  // Main method signature
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");  // Outputting text to the console
    }
    ```
    
    - **Static**: The `Main` method is static, meaning you don’t need to create an instance of the `Program` class to call it.
    - **Return Type**: The `Main` method usually has a `void` return type, but it can also return an `int` to indicate the program's exit status.
5. **Statements and Expressions**
    
    C# programs are written using **statements**. A statement is an instruction that the program executes. Most statements end with a semicolon (`;`).
    
    **Example of a statement:**
    
    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");  // A statement that prints to the console
    ```
    
    C# also supports **expressions**, which evaluate to values. For example, an assignment expression:
    
    ```csharp
    int x = 5;  // Assignment expression
    ```
    
6.  **Curly Braces `{}`**
    
    C# uses curly braces `{}` to group code together. For example, in the `Main` method or in a `class`, curly braces define the block of code that belongs together.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Code inside the Main method
        }
    }
    ```
    
7. **Access Modifiers**
    
    C# uses **access modifiers** to define the visibility of types and their members. The most common access modifiers are:
    
    - **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere (inside and outside the class).
    - **`private`**: Accessible only within the class.
    - **`protected`**: Accessible within the class and derived classes.
    - **`internal`**: Accessible within the same assembly (project).
    - **`protected internal`**: Accessible within the same assembly and derived classes.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    class Program
    {
        public int number;  // Public member, accessible from outside the class
        private string name;  // Private member, accessible only within this class
    }
    ```
    
8. **Methods**
    
    Methods in C# define behavior. They contain code that can be executed when called. A method in C# typically includes:
    
    - **Return Type**: Specifies what type of value the method returns (e.g., `void`, `int`, `string`).
    - **Name**: The identifier for the method.
    - **Parameters**: Inputs that the method accepts (optional).
    - **Body**: The block of code that defines the method's functionality.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    class Program
    {
        static void Greet(string name)  // Method that takes a string parameter
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");  // Prints a greeting
        }
    
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Greet("Alice");  // Calling the method
        }
    }
    ```
    
9. **Properties and Fields**
    - **Fields**: Variables defined within a class, typically private.
    - **Properties**: Special methods used to access the values of fields (getters and setters).
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    class Person
    {
        private string name;  // Field
    
        public string Name    // Property
        {
            get { return name; }  // Getter
            set { name = value; }  // Setter
        }
    }
    ```
    
10.  **Commenting Code**
    
    In C#, you can add comments to your code to explain what’s going on. Comments are ignored by the compiler but help others (or yourself) understand your code.
    
    - **Single-line comments**: Use `//` for comments on a single line.
    - **Multi-line comments**: Use `/* */` to comment out multiple lines.
    - **XML Documentation comments**: Use `///` to create documentation comments that can be used for auto-generating documentation.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    // This is a single-line comment
    
    /*
    This is a
    multi-line comment
    */
    
    /**
     * This is an XML documentation comment.
     */
    
    ```

## **Putting It All Together**

Here is a full example that illustrates many of these concepts:

```csharp
Using System;  // Importing the System namespace

namespace MyProgram  // Defining the namespace
{
    class Program  // Declaring the Program class
    {
        // A field with a property
        private string message;

        public string Message  // Property to access the field
        {
            get { return message; }
            set { message = value; }
        }

        // A method to print a message
        static void PrintMessage(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }

        // The entry point of the program
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Program program = new Program();  // Creating an instance of Program
            program.Message = "Hello, C#!";   // Setting the message property
            PrintMessage(program.Message);   // Calling the method to print the message
        }
    }
}
```

## **Summary**

The basic structure of a C# program includes:

1. **Using Directives**: To import namespaces.
2. **Namespace**: To logically organize code.
3. **Class**: The building block of C# programs.
4. **Main Method**: The entry point of the program.
5. **Methods, Fields, and Properties**: To define behavior and data.
6. **Access Modifiers**: To control the visibility of code members.

C# follows an object-oriented paradigm, and its structure revolves around classes and methods.
