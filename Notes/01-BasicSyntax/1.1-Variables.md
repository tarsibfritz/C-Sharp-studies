## Declaring Variables

In C#, a variable is declared by specifying its type followed by its name. For example:

```csharp
int age;  // Declares an integer variable called age
```

A variable can be optionally initialized with a value:

```csharp
int age = 25;  // Declares and initializes the variable age
```

## Variable Naming Rules

C# has specific rules and conventions for naming variables:

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`), followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- They cannot contain spaces or special characters (except underscore).
- By convention, variable names are written in **camelCase** (e.g., `studentAge`, `totalAmount`).
- Reserved keywords (such as `int`, `bool`, `class`) cannot be used as variable names.

> C# is a case-sensitive language.

Example of valid names:

```csharp
int numberOfStudents = 50;
double totalAmount = 123.45;
```

## Initialization and Assignment

Variables can be initialized at the time of declaration, or you can declare them first and assign a value later:

```csharp
int a;        // Declare the variable
a = 10;       // Assign a value to the variable
```

If you try to use a variable without assigning a value, you'll get a compile-time error (for local variables).

## Type Inference with var

Variables can be initialized at the time of declaration, or you can declare them first and assign a value later:

```csharp
int a;        // Declare the variable
a = 10;       // Assign a value to the variable
```

If you try to use a variable without assigning a value, you'll get a compile-time error (for local variables).

## **Variable Scope and Lifetime**

The **scope** of a variable defines where it can be accessed within the program, and its **lifetime** defines how long it exists.

- **Local Variables**: These are declared within a method or block and are only accessible within that method or block. They are created when the method is called and destroyed when the method exits.
    
    ```csharp
    void MyMethod()
    {
        int localVar = 10;  // localVar is only accessible inside MyMethod
    }
    ```
    
- **Instance Variables (Fields)**: These are declared in a class outside of any method and are accessible to all methods within the class. They represent the state of an object and are created when the object is created.
    
    ```csharp
    class MyClass
    {
        int instanceVar;  // This is an instance variable
    }
    ```
    
- **Static Variables**: These belong to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. They are shared by all instances of the class.
    
    ```csharp
    class MyClass
    {
        static int staticVar = 100;  // This is shared across all instances of MyClass
    }
    ```

## **Destructuring Variables (Tuples)**

C# also supports the use of **tuples**, where you can store multiple values in a single variable. These values can be destructured into separate variables:

```csharp
var person = (name: "John", age: 30);  // Tuple with two elements
var (name, age) = person;  // Destructure the tuple
```

---

## **Using Variables in Expressions**

You can use variables in expressions to perform arithmetic or logical operations:

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int sum = x + y;  // 15
bool isEqual = (x == y);  // false
```
